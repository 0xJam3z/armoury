# Armoury

![](img/logo.png)

Armoury is just a quick inventory, reminder and launcher for pentest commands.
<br>This project written by pentesters for pentesters simplify the use of all the hard-to-remember commands

In arsenal you can search for a command, select one and it's prefilled directly in your terminal. This functionality is independent of the shell used. Indeed arsenal emulates real user input (with TTY arguments and IOCTL) so arsenal works with all shells and your commands will be in the history.

You have to enter arguments if needed, but armoury supports global variables. <br>
For example, during a pentest we can set the variable `ip` to prefill all commands using an ip with the right one.

To do that you just have to enter the following command in armoury:
```
>set ip=10.10.10.10
``` 
Armoury is an Arsenal fork for more up-to-date and additional tools.

This project is inspired by navi (<https://github.com/denisidoro/navi>) because the original version was in bash and too hard to understand to add features

```
armoury
```

- manually:
```
git clone https://github.com/0xJam3z/armoury.git
cd armoury
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./run
```

Inside your .bashrc or .zshrc add the path to `run` to help you do that you could launch the addalias.sh script
```
./addalias.sh
```


## Add a prefix commands generated

In order to prefix commands generated by arsenal you need to set the `armoury_prefix_cmd` global variable. 

For example if you need your commands to be prefixed with `proxychains -q`:
```
>set armoury_prefix_cmd=proxychains -q
```

then you can start run arsenal with the prefix option:
```bash
armoury -f
```
