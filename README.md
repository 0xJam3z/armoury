## Add a Prefix To Commands

In order to prefix commands generated by armoury you need to set the `armoury_prefix_cmd` global variable. 

For example if you need your commands to be prefixed with `proxychains -q`:
```
>set armoury_prefix_cmd=proxychains -q
```

then you can start run armoury with the prefix option:
```
armoury -f
```

# Troubleshooting (From [Arsenal](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/arsenal))
```
========== OSError ============
Armoury needs TIOCSTI enable for running
Please run the following commands as root to fix this issue on the current session :
sysctl -w dev.tty.legacy_tiocsti=1
If you want this workaround to survive a reboot,
add the following configuration to sysctl.conf file and reboot :
echo "dev.tty.legacy_tiocsti=1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
