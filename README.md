## Add a prefix commands generated

In order to prefix commands generated by armoury you need to set the `armoury_prefix_cmd` global variable. 

For example if you need your commands to be prefixed with `proxychains -q`:
```
>set armoury_prefix_cmd=proxychains -q
```

then you can start run armoury with the prefix option:
```
armoury -f
```
